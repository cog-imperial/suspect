Convexity Detection for Pyomo
=============================

This library implements methods to:

* Detect convex and concave expressions
* Detect increasing and decreasing expressions
* Detect linear, quadratic and polynomial expressions
* Tighten an expression bounds

The library is based on Fourer, Orban 2010, extending it to handle large expressions.
